# Tutorial

This is a small code tutorial from a course I had during my bachelors. I think these libraries are
super useful!

This example network represents the main roads between cities in Europe. Each node is a city and there is a
link between two cities if they are connected by a main road (E-number). The nodes contain a 
parameter [city] which stores the name of the city.

The data was hosted by the KONECT database. Unfortunately, it seems to be offline at the moment.

To display the network you can use the Display EU Roads Network Jupyter notebook.
